#  Universal Remote Control with Arduino üïπÔ∏èüåê

<h5>Description:</h5>
Turn your Arduino into a versatile universal remote control! This project empowers you to consolidate the control of various devices, including TVs, audio systems, and smart home gadgets, using a single Arduino-based interface. Explore the world of DIY home automation with this customizable and extensible remote control solution.
Hello and welcome to the Universal Remote Control project! 
This project is designed to allow you to control multiple devices using a single remote control. 
This read-me file will provide an overview of the project and instructions on how to use it.<br>
 

<h5>Features:</h5><br>
1. Arduino-based universal remote<br>
2. Infrared (IR) signal support<br>
3. Extensive device database for easy configuration<br>
4. Customizable buttons and layouts<br>
5. Learning mode for capturing custom remote commands<br>
6. Integration with smart home devices<br>


<h5>How to Get Started:</h5><br>
1. Clone the repository<br>
2. Upload the Arduino sketch to your board<br>
3. Configure your devices using the provided documentation<br>
4. Personalize your remote control layout and functionality<br>


<h5>Overview:</h5><br>
The Universal Remote Control project consists of the following components:

Microcontroller<br>
Infrared (IR) receiver<br>
Infrared (IR) transmitter<br>
Display (optional)<br>
Remote control codes<br>
The microcontroller receives the IR signals from the remote control and transmits the corresponding IR signals to the devices using the IR transmitter. The display is optional and can be used to show the current status of the device being controlled.<br>

<h5>Instructions:</h5><br>
Set up the hardware components as shown in the circuit diagram provided.
Upload the code to the microcontroller using the Arduino IDE.
Use the IR receiver to learn the codes from your existing remote controls. The code to learn IR signals is included in the code.
Edit the code to include the learned codes for each device you want to control.
Use the remote control to control your devices.

hope you enjoy using the Universal Remote Control project! Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions or feedback.
